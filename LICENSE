Customer may manage up to 10 Concurrent Service Instances perpetually, at no charge (a "Free License").  Alternatively, Customer may manage more than 10 Concurrent Service Instances for a specific term listed in an Order in exchange for a fee; the specific fee, number of Concurrent Service Instances allowed and term will be stated in Customer's Order or in a license file sent to Customer by ClearCode Labs (a "Paid License").

 6. INDEMNIFICATION BY ClearCode Labs.  This Section 6 only applies to Paid Licenses.

ClearCode Labs will pay all damages awarded against Customer directly resulting from such Claims ("Losses").  The foregoing obligation is conditioned on Customer notifying ClearCode Labs promptly in writing of such Claim, Customer giving ClearCode Labs sole control of the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations, and Customer cooperating and, at ClearCode Labs' reasonable request and expense, assisting in such defense. If, as a result of a Claim, or a Claim that is reasonably anticipated by ClearCode Labs, Customer's use of the Software is or may be temporarily or permanently enjoined or otherwise legally prevented or prohibited, ClearCode Labs will, at ClearCode Labs' sole option, either: (a) procure for Customer the right to continue using the affected materials in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (b) modify the materials so as to make them non- infringing, provided that the modified materials continue to substantially conform to all applicable documentation; or (c) if neither of the foregoing are reasonably available or commercially practical in ClearCode Labs's sole opinion, ClearCode Labs will refund any portion of the fees paid by Customer for unused periods of the subscription term (or, if a perpetual Paid License, those portions attributable to the unused part of a five (5) year straight line depreciation schedule). Notwithstanding the foregoing, ClearCode Labs will have no obligation, under this Section 6 or otherwise, with respect to any infringement claim based upon or otherwise relating to: (i) any unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution of any the Software; (ii) any use of the Software in combination with other products, services, equipment, software, or data not supplied by ClearCode Labs; (iii) any modification of the Software by any person other than ClearCode Labs or its authorized agents or contractors; or (iv) any software not licensed by ClearCode Labs.
